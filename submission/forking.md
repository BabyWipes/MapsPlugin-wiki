Forking and Cloning a Repository
================================

In order to edit the code contained in the [OresomeCraft/MapsPlugin repository](http://github.com/OresomeCraft/MapsPlugin), you'll need to create a 'fork' of the repository.
This can be done by clicking the classy 'fork' button in the top right bar. GitHub will then create a copy of the repository just for you, and redirect you to it.
This fork will now appear in the 'repositories' tab of your user profile.

From here, you can directly edit files in your browser by opening a file and clicking the 'edit' button. This isn't always very practical, however.
It is often easier to edit files from the friendly world of your desktop, using your favorite editor. This can be done by cloning your fork.
There are several ways to clone a repository. All of the following methods will require a form of 'git' (a program that GitHub runs on to manage repositories) to be installed.

For new GitHub users, it's often very easy to install GitHub's [snazzy client for windows](http://windows.github.com) or [mac](http://mac.github.com). Once downloaded, it will allow you to simply click the 'clone in desktop' button when viewing a repository for the repository to be downloaded right to your computer.
If you're up for a challenge, however, you can install the command-line version of [git](http://git-scm.com/). Once installed, git allows you to execute cloning commands from your terminal or command prompt window.
To clone the OresomeCraft MapsPlugin using command-line git, simply open up a command prompt or terminal window and enter: ```git clone https://github.com/<Your Username Here>/MapsPlugin.git```. The MapsPlugin repository should then be downloaded to your main user or documents folder.
