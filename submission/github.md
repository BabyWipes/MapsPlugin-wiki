Introduction to GitHub
======================

In order to start contributing to the OresomeCraft Maps Plugin, it is necessary to register a GitHub account.

[Registration Instructions]

Once your account has been created, and you have logged in, GitHub will create your own user profile page that shows all the code contributions you've made!
Your user profile page will display interesting information at a glance, such as the amount of commits you've made or how many repositories you've starred.

By clicking the tabs at the top of the page, you can also view your repositories (including the forks of repositories you've made), and your public activity stream.
You can also access your account settings using the tool icon at the top right of the page.
