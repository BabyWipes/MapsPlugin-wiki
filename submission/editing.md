Editing the MapsPlugin Code
===========================

Once you've cloned the MapsPlugin repository, you may want to edit the code; perhaps to add a new map configuration file.
To do this, open up an explorer window and navigate to the cloned repository.
Open up the 'src' folder, then navigate to 'com\oresomecraft\maps\battles\maps'. If you'd like to add an OresomeKart or arcade map, you can also navigate to 'com\oresomecraft\maps\oresomekart\maps' or 'com\oresomecraft\maps\arcade\maps'.

From there, simply create a new java file for your map config (for example SereneWaters.java), and write your map configuration inside that file using your favorite text editor.
If you plan on adding complex abilities for your map, it may be suitable to install a java Integrated Development Environment (IDE). An IDE will perform java error checking as you type, and make sure you're on the right track when adding new maps.
Using an IDE can require a little technical knowledge, however, so it's usually recommended for advanced users. OresomeCraft reccomends the [IntelliJ IDEA IDE](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).
Some other IDEs include the [Eclipse IDE](http://www.eclipse.org/) and [NetBeans](https://netbeans.org/).
