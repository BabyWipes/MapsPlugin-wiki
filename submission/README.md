Map Submission
==============

Once a map has been configured, it needs to be submitted to OresomeCraft so that the map configuration file can be placed inside the OresomeCraft Maps Plugin.
To do this, OresomeCraft uses a website called ['GitHub'](http://github.com), which displays the code for the Maps Plugin on the web, for anybody to see, view and edit.
GitHub allows anybody to submit new map configuration files and contribute to the Maps Plugin java code. Using GitHub, you can even [contribute to this guide](http://github.com/OresomeCraft/MapsPlugin-wiki)!

The OresomeCraft Maps Plugin code can be found in the [OresomeCraft/MapsPlugin GitHub repository](http://github.com/OresomeCraft/MapsPlugin).
