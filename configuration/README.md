Map Configuration
=================

For a map to work on OresomeCraft battles, a map must be configured. Each map on battles has a configuration file.
These files are written in [Java code](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/) and include all the information necessary for a battles map to be played on the OresomeCraft network.

In this section, you will learn how to create a new map configuration file from scratch and submit it to the [OresomeCraft Maps Plugin](http://github.com/OresomeCraft/MapsPlugin) using java code.
Don't worry, java code isn't rocket science. Once you try out a few exercises in this tutorial, it'll feel easy!

There are a few things you should know about Java code and the OresomeCraft Maps Plugin before we start:

- In java code, anything in a line after '//' is a comment, and therefore isn't run in the code. For example, if I write ```// This is a comment```; it won't be run in the code.
- In java code, a 'class' often simply means a file in which java code is stored.
- All OresomeCraft Map Configuration Files are stored online, on a website called [GitHub](http://github.com/oresomecraft/MapsPlugin). Feel free to take a look!
